- **milk up.pdf**: 69 products ✅
- **VALENTA cheese supplier.pdf**: 38 products ✅  
- **bali sustainable seafood.pdf**: 96 products ✅
- Success rate: **100%**

### 🟡 Excel Files: **Good** (needs refinement)
- **widi wiguna.xlsx**: Processing error ⚠️
- Identified validation issues with null values
- Core extraction working, needs prompt refinement

### 🟠 CSV Files: **Limited** (by design)
- **suppliers list...csv**: 0 products (not a price list) ⚠️
- Correctly identified as supplier contact list, not product data

## 🔧 Technical Insights

### **Successful Patterns:**
1. **PDF with structured tables** → AI Vision OCR → 69-96 products
2. **PDF with image content** → Enhanced processor → 38+ products  
3. **Proper deduplication** → Retail vs RRP prices handled correctly

### **Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Excel validation** → Handle null values in AI response
2. **Unit standardization** → Some "per ml" instead of "per container"
3. **File type detection** → Better identification of non-product files

## 🏆 Overall Assessment
