## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Production Server
```bash
ssh [user]@209.38.85.196
cd [project-path]
```

### Step 2: Backup Current Version
```bash
cp -r . ../monito-web-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 3: Apply Changes
Copy these files to production server:

1. **Upload new admin page:**
   ```bash
   # Create directory if not exists
   mkdir -p app/admin/uploads
   
   # Copy new page component
   scp app/admin/uploads/page.tsx [user]@209.38.85.196:[project-path]/app/admin/uploads/
   ```

2. **Upload quality control utilities:**
   ```bash
   scp app/lib/utils/quality-control.ts [user]@209.38.85.196:[project-path]/app/lib/utils/
   ```

3. **Update standardization settings:**
   ```bash
   scp app/lib/utils/standardization.ts [user]@209.38.85.196:[project-path]/app/lib/utils/
   ```

4. **Update environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Update .env on production:
   AI_STANDARDIZATION_ENABLED=true
   LLM_MODEL=o3-mini-2025-01-31
   ```

5. **Upload testing suite:**
   ```bash
   scp tests/uploads.spec.ts [user]@209.38.85.196:[project-path]/tests/
   ```

### Step 4: Build and Restart
```bash
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart monito-web
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
```bash
curl -I http://209.38.85.196:3000/admin/uploads
# Should return 200 instead of 404
```

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Manual Testing:
1. Navigate to `http://209.38.85.196:3000/admin/uploads`
2. Verify 2 pending uploads are displayed
3. Test Preview functionality
4. Test Approve/Reject actions
5. Verify real-time updates work

### Automated Testing:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/uploads.spec.ts --config=playwright.config.production.ts
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Deployment:
- ❌ `/admin/uploads` → 404 Not Found
- ✅ `/api/uploads/pending` → 2 uploads available

### After Deployment:
- ✅ `/admin/uploads` → Full management interface
- ✅ Statistics: "Pending Review: 2"
- ✅ Upload items: "Island Organics Bali.pdf" entries
- ✅ Action buttons: Preview, Approve, Reject functional

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Admin Access:
- Page requires admin authentication (already implemented)
- Actions require approver identification
- Rate limiting on approve/reject operations (10s cooldown)

### API Security:
- All upload APIs have proper authentication
- File access controls in place
- Input validation on all endpoints

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Bundle Size:
- +1 new page component (~15KB)
- +1 quality control utility (~5KB)
- Minimal impact on build time

### Runtime Performance:
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Efficient pagination (10 items per page)
- Client-side caching of upload lists

## 🎉 Benefits After Deployment

1. **Complete UI for uploads management** - No more API-only workflow
2. **Real-time monitoring** - Live status updates for administrators
3. **Improved accuracy** - Enhanced o3-mini standardization with quality control
4. **Better UX** - Preview before approve, detailed statistics
5. **Automated testing** - Full test coverage for all upload functionality

## 🆘 Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
cd ../monito-web-backup-[date]
cp -r . ../monito-web/
cd ../monito-web
pm2 restart monito-web
```

## 📞 Support

After deployment, the uploads interface will be fully operational and ready for production use with the existing 2 pending uploads from Island Organics Bali.
