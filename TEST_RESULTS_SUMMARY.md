## Price Validation Analysis

### Common Warnings:
1. **Price range violations**: Many products exceed category maximums
   - Cheese products > 2M IDR (expected max)
   - Butter products > 500K IDR (expected max)
   - Specialty items (nuts, honey) > 5M IDR

2. **Unit mismatches**: 
   - 'pcs' used for bulk items
   - Long unit descriptions parsed as units
   - Missing standard units (kg, gr, ltr)

### Indonesian Price Format
- ✅ **FIXED**: Prices with dots as thousand separators now parse correctly
- Example: 316.350 → 316,350 IDR (not 316.35)

## Recommendations

### 1. Adjust Price Validation Ranges
- Current ranges too conservative for premium/imported products
- Need category-specific adjustments for:
  - Premium cheese: up to 5M IDR
  - Specialty flour/nuts: up to 10M IDR
  - Bulk butter (25kg): up to 5M IDR

### 2. Improve PDF Extraction
- VALENTA and Island Organics have very low extraction rates
- May need specific handling for their layouts

### 3. Unit Standardization
- Better parsing of complex unit descriptions
- Handle bulk packaging (e.g., "24x500ml")

### 4. Test Missing Files
- 3 Excel files not in results
- 1 CSV file not tested
- 1 JPG file not tested

## Conclusion

The improvements successfully fixed the Indonesian price format issue. Most files are being processed with reasonable success rates, though some PDFs still need better extraction methods. The price validation is working but needs tuning for Indonesian market prices.
