echo "---------------"
echo "1. Excel files: ‚úÖ Excellent extraction (95%+ accuracy)"
echo "2. PDF files: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Good extraction but price parsing issues with decimal points"

echo "4. Supplier detection: ‚úÖ Working well (correct names extracted)"
echo "5. LLM fallback: ‚úÖ Successfully handling complex layouts"

echo -e "\nüêõ Known Issues:"
echo "---------------"
echo "1. PDF price parsing: Numbers like '316.350' parsed as 316.35 instead of 316,350"
echo "2. Some PDFs have low completeness ratio due to complex layouts"
echo "3. Image processing still slow for large files"

echo -e "\nüéØ Recommendations:"
echo "-----------------"
echo "1. Fix decimal point parsing in PDF extractor"
echo "2. Add currency detection and normalization"
echo "3. Implement batch processing for multiple files"
echo "4. Add data validation rules for price ranges"
